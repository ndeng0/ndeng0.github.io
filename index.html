        My name is Norman and I'm currently an undergraduate at Stony Brook University. I'm studing in Information Systems as a student
        and trying to figure out game design durring my free time. I aim to become a game developer and designer in the future and hope
        to be able to release my own game into the world. I also love to play games especially multiplayer games where you play with friends.

              Java is the first programming language I learned and the one I am most experienced in. I have used Java in my AP Computer Science
              course in High School and Data Structure course in College. Recently I have been using a library built on Java in order to experiment
              with game design and teach others how to code as well.

              Most of my knowledge on Python was self taught. I learned Python through online videos and experimenting with the language itself.
              Currently I am using Python in a Data Science course alongside the NumPy and Panda library. By the end of the semester I would have
              use Python, NumPy, and Pandas to complete a project for my Data Science course. I have also used Python alongside other libraries
              such as Ren'Py and Pygames.

              Processing is a graphical library built using Java. Being experienced in Java already I was able to learn Processing easily.
              I taught myself Processing through online videos and resources and by experimenting with the library itself. While learning
              Processing I was able to use this library to recreate certain video game, Pong and Flappy Bird, as exercises to help me better
              understand it. I have also used Processing to introduce and teach others how to code.

              <p>
                Stony Brook Game Developers is a club dedicated to teaching others about game development and design. Every meeting a presenter, either
                an eboard member, student, or guest speaker, gives a presentation on an aspect on game development or the industry. Everything is discussed
                from how to build your first game to getting it out into the market. There are also the occasional game jams to see who builds the best game. </br> </br>
                I have been a member of the club for almost 2 years and is currently an active memeber. Recently I have given a presentation on making games
                with Processing and I plan on doing more presentations in the future.
              </p>

            <h4>Playing Games</h4>
            <p>
              During my free time I like to play games, usually PC games. I enjoy playing with friends as it allows us to socialize and relax. To see some of the games
              I play go down to the games tab.
            </p>
            <h4>Studying Game Design</h4>
            <p>
              During my free time I like to study game design, how and what makes a good game. I do this by using online resources and going to the Stony Brook Game
              Developers Club. I aim to be able to create my own game and release it for everyone to play.

            <h4>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</h4>
            <p>
              Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical first person shooter with an emphasis on environmental destruction and teamwork. </br> </br>
              The reason I like this game is due to its emphasis on teamwork. In order to win you must outsmart your opponents and manipulate the environment
              to your advantage. Being able to win by outsmart your opponents and teamwork is very satisfying. The game also keeps itself fresh by constantly
              putting out updates that changes the dymanics of the game.
            </p>
            <h4>Terraria</h4>
            <p>
              Terraria is a 2D sandbox game that takes place in a world filled with monsters and adventure. </br> </br>
              The reason I like this game is due to its sandbox nature. You explore the world gathering resources in order to become better equiped against the
              monsters inhabiting the world. As you progress you'll encounter bosses that when defeated will drop valuable loot. Being able to build as you please
              and becoming stronger as time progress is very enjoyable for me.
            </p>
            <h4>Apex Legends</h4>
            <p>
              Apex Legends is a first person shooter battle royale game recently released on PC. </br> </br>
              The reason I like this game due to its unpredictable matches. When spawning in you have to pick up items and build up your arsenal against
              other players. Items you pick up are random and can be either good or bad. Losing while being unprepared can be frustrating, which make winning all the
              more satisfying.
